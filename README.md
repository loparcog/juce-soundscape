# Soundscape
A JUCE-based application to create ambient sound through randomly generated waveforms

# TODO
- &check; Set up `Bird` class as a basis for other sound classes
- &cross; Create dummy `Director` to manage sound class calls
  - This has become weird so I will probably be making the base sound class sooner
- &cross; Link Director playback to UI
- &cross; Expand `Director` class to handle dynamic object creation
- &cross; Create base parameter control from UI to Director
- &cross; Create base sound class to inherit from
- &cross; Expand sound classes
- &cross; Expand UI for further param control and UX
